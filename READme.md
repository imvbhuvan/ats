# Resume Parsing System



The Resume Evaluation System is designed to assist companies in assessing the alignment between candidates' resumes and the specified job description. The process involves the following steps:

1. The company initiates the evaluation by inputting the job description for the relevant position.
2. Subsequently, the system accommodates the uploading of multiple resumes associated with the role.
3. Upon selecting the "Process Resumes" option, the application provides a comprehensive output comprising the candidate's Name, email, contact number, and a percentage indicating the degree of compatibility with the job description.

Noteworthy features include the system's capability to process numerous resumes simultaneously, with all relevant candidate details being systematically recorded in an Excel sheet for further analysis and record-keeping.
